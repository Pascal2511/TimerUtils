The TimerUtils libarry provides a convenient way to manage time intervals in Arduino sketches. It helps to execute code at specific intervals without the need for complex timing calculations.

The everyMs method of the TimerUtils class allows you to specify a time interval in milliseconds. It returns true if the specified interval has elapsed since the last time the method was called, allowing you to execute code periodically with ease.
